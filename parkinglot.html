							<p>This is a process to design a application to help troubled drivers.</br>
								  As observed there are many drivers who face parking problems when they are in a hurry.
								So I tried to chalk out a initial plan to do a user research on the drivers in my college.
								The first step was to do a qualitiative analysis on the drivers in the parking lot by just
								observing their behavior. The second step was to take interviews with the drivers while
								they drive and ask them appropriate questions. As we got the problem scenarios we designed
								the personae (profiles) of the participants. The forth step was to create a story board
								and scenarios.</p>

							<p><b>Observation: -</b> In all 96 cars were observed. Out of which 56 drivers parked their cars and 40 left
								the parking lot. On an average driver took approximately 50 seconds to 1.5minutes to park their car,
								this time depended on how the driver approached the parking space. Drivers arrive in 3 to 4 minutes of
								time intervals. It can be a case that it might be a start of lecture, which caused an initial rush.
								Drivers were mostly students, a few college staff and professors. It was a cold day so everybody had
								his or her sweaters on. The ratio was 65 males to 31 females. Female drivers took 40% more time to park
								that to males. Students who were to attend lectures parked their cars near to row 1 in the parking lot,
								where as the staff preferred parking spaces after 3rd row. Almost all the cars entered or exited the parking
								lot from gate number 2, which is on the right hand side of the image shown on the first page. Drivers
								were aged between 20-50 approximately. Some observations that led to some research questions and interview
								questions were, some drivers found it hard to find a parking space as some cars were categorized in
								SUV that are big heavy duty vehicles which obstructed their sight to recognize a available parking
								space behind it. The initial rush to the parking lot made me curious to ask some interview questions
								regarding the selection of the parking lot and the parking space that they choose. As per observations
								too many cars were parked in S parking lot and too many left as well, how convenient was it for the
								drivers to find a space and if not what measures can be taken to reduce the problem to minimal. One
								very odd observation made was not all people parked their cars in the same fashion. Some parked their
								cars towards the end line of the car park and some parked away from it, i.e. either the cars tail faced
								the end yellow line or the cars head faced the end yellow line. Which made me a bit curious to ask this
								observation as an interview question to the person to be interviewed. One possible answer that came
								to my mind was maybe some people are well organized and because some people don’t like to go reverse
								while leaving the lot and it makes them easy to leave rather then wasting time to reverse the car and
								then turn to desired direction.</p>

							<p>To conduct interview with the drivers going to the parking lot (walk through process).</p>
							<p><b>Research Question and Interview Questions: - </b>  From the initial observations, several
								possible research questions arise.  A basic question would simply be: “How convenient is parking at RIT?”
								This might result in a variety of qualitative answers, but these answers would likely be different depending
								upon the particular parking lot in question and the time of day being considered.  Note that different
								group members performed observations for this study independently and different lots were observed at
								different times.  While the data recorded suggests that access to parking in Lot J between 8:15 and
								9:15 on a Thursday was fairly easy, the data recorded for Lot E is quite different, indicating that
								very few spaces were available there during the 4:00 to 5:00 interval.  Therefore, a more specific
								research question might be more helpful, such as: “What improvements could be made to the RIT parking
								system to make parking more convenient?” or even better: “Does driver usage of RIT parking lots suggest
								ways that the parking system could be improved?”  This last question lends itself to data collection
								and further study, since it targets an observable phenomenon – the behavior of drivers who use the RIT
								parking lots.  The goal of this research is to learn whether the observed behavior can be used to identify
								problems with the current system, and if so, whether any improvements suggest themselves.</p>

							<p>To conduct interview with the drivers going to the parking lot (walk through process).</p>
							<p> 
							I would like to
							park as close as possible to Golisano Hall, in Lot J. There are four entrances to the main part of
							the lot from this road, but I know that the two closest sections of the lot are for “Reserved” permits
							only, and I have my husband’s General permit, so I have to choose one of the two northernmost entrances.
							The lot looks to be at least half full, and of course the closest sections fill up first. I can’t see
							clearly if there are any available spaces, but I have about ten minutes to spare before meeting my
							husband, so I’ll take a chance and choose the closer entrance. As I turn right into the lot and head
							west, I see two cars heading toward me from the other side of the lot – maybe one of them has just
							left an open spot. I continue down the row, but don’t find any open spaces in the eastern half of
							the lot. I pause at the central crosswalk to yield to a couple of pedestrians. I continue through
							the lot and reach the western side without finding any open spaces. Those other drivers must have
							been looking for parking too. I turn right and then right again to head back east down the next row.
							I see some open spaces, but I want to go as close as I can to the central crosswalk so I pass a few
							spaces – it’s hard to see if there are any closer ones, so I pick one about eight spaces from the
							crosswalk, on the left side. I use my turn signal and slow down, and then carefully turn left into
							the space, and then put the car in park. I turn off the car, get out, then close and lock the door
							behind me. From here it will take me about ten minutes to walk to the building, and since it took me
							an extra minute or so to find an available space, I might be a few minutes late to meet my husband.
							I’ll text him to let him know.</br></br>
							<b>Design Scenario:</b></br>
							<b>Persona:</b> Aniket Tanawade, R.I.T Student
							</br>
							<b>Setting:</b> RIT Parking Lot S
							</br>
							I’m driving to RIT today for my 9:30 class in Brown Hall. It’s cool and rainy today, so I hope I don’t
							have to walk too far in the rain. I’m driving my 2013 Volkswagen Polo, and I have my “Reserved” permit
							to allow me to park in the closest spaces to the buildings. The lot is very popular and the closest
							spaces are often full, so as I enter from Tyler Drive on the west side, I look up to consult the
							LotMonitor at the entrance. The LotMonitor consists of a 8 x 8 foot square display monitor mounted
							on a pole at the west side of Lot S, and at the top it displays in large bright green text: “Available
							Spaces: 200 of 622”. Beneath that, there is a graphical representation of Lot S, with all the occupied
							spaces indicated with a red ‘O’ and all vacant spaces indicated with a green ‘V’. Handicapped spaces
							are outlined with a blue rectangle and reserved spaces are outlined with a yellow diamond shape. The
							colors are a quick indication for those with typical vision, while the letters provide the necessary
							information for colorblind drivers. The building is on the east side of the lot, and I can see that
							all of the closest spaces in the second and third rows are filled, but the fourth row has several open
							spaces fairly close to the east side of the lot, so I turn right at the fourth row and drive toward
							the building. I see one car heading east in front of me in the same row, and the driver parks in a
							free spot on the left. I saw on the display that there were still two more available spots on the
							right side of the row further east, so I continue driving, and I find the open spaces, as expected.
							I use my turn signal and pull into a space. I know that the LotMonitor’s sensors in the parking lot
							will detect my car and change this space from a white rectangle to a Red signal to indicate to later
							arrivals that this space is no longer available. The number of available spaces will also be decremented
							as necessary. I get out, lock the car, and head to my 9:30 class; it looks like I’ll be five minutes early.
