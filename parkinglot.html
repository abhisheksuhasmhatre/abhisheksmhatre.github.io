							<p>
								This is a process to design an application to assist troubled
								drivers. As observed, many drivers encounter parking problems
								when they are in a hurry. So, I've outlined an initial plan
								to conduct user research on drivers in my college.</br>

								The first step involves conducting a qualitative analysis of
								the drivers in the parking lot by observing their behavior.
								The second step is to conduct interviews with drivers while
								they drive and ask them appropriate questions. Once we gather
								the problem scenarios, we can proceed to design the personas
								(profiles) of the participants.</br>

								The fourth step is to create a storyboard and scenarios.</p>

								<b>Observation: -</b> In total, 96 cars were observed, with
								56 drivers parking their cars and 40 leaving the parking lot.
								On average, drivers took approximately 50 seconds to 1.5 minutes
								to park their cars, depending on their approach to the parking
								space. Drivers arrived at intervals of 3 to 4 minutes, possibly
								due to the start of a lecture causing an initial rush. The drivers
								were mostly students, with a few college staff and professors.
								It was a cold day, so everyone was wearing sweaters. The gender
								ratio was 65 males to 31 females. Female drivers took 40% more
								time to park than males. Students attending lectures parked their
								cars near row 1, while staff preferred spaces after the 3rd row.
								Most cars entered or exited the parking lot from gate number 2,
								which is on the right-hand side of the image on the first page.
								The drivers' ages ranged between 20 and 50 approximately. </br>

								Some observations led to research and interview questions.
								For instance, some drivers struggled to find parking spaces
								due to SUVs obstructing their view. The initial rush to the
								parking lot prompted questions about parking lot selection
								and space choice. Additionally, there were too many cars in
								the S parking lot, leading to questions about convenience and
								potential solutions.</br>

								Another odd observation was the varying parking styles, with
								some cars parked close to the end line and others farther away.
								This prompted questions about organizational preferences and
								ease of departure. One possible explanation could be that some
								people prefer not to reverse while leaving the lot, making it
								easier for them to exit without wasting time.

								<b>Research Question and Interview Questions: - </b>
								From the initial observations, several potential research
								questions arise. A fundamental inquiry would be: “How convenient
								is parking at RIT?” This could yield various qualitative responses,
								likely differing based on the specific parking lot and time of day.
								It's worth noting that different team members conducted independent
								observations, and different lots were surveyed at different times.
								While the data indicates that accessing parking in Lot J between
								8:15 and 9:15 on a Thursday was relatively easy, findings for
								Lot E present a contrasting picture, showing limited available
								spaces during the 4:00 to 5:00 interval. Hence, a more precise
								research question might prove more beneficial, such as: “What
								enhancements could enhance the RIT parking system's convenience?”
								or better yet: “Do drivers' utilization of RIT parking lots
								suggest potential improvements to the parking system?” This
								latter question lends itself to data collection and further
								exploration, as it targets an observable phenomenon – the behavior
								of drivers utilizing RIT parking lots. The aim of this research
								is to ascertain whether the observed behavior can identify
								issues with the current system and, if so, whether any improvements
								become apparent.

							<p>To conduct interview with the drivers going to the parking lot (walk through process).</p>
							<p> 
							I would like to
							park as close as possible to Golisano Hall, in Lot J. There are four entrances to the main part of
							the lot from this road, but I know that the two closest sections of the lot are for “Reserved” permits
							only, and I have my husband’s General permit, so I have to choose one of the two northernmost entrances.
							The lot looks to be at least half full, and of course the closest sections fill up first. I can’t see
							clearly if there are any available spaces, but I have about ten minutes to spare before meeting my
							husband, so I’ll take a chance and choose the closer entrance. As I turn right into the lot and head
							west, I see two cars heading toward me from the other side of the lot – maybe one of them has just
							left an open spot. I continue down the row, but don’t find any open spaces in the eastern half of
							the lot. I pause at the central crosswalk to yield to a couple of pedestrians. I continue through
							the lot and reach the western side without finding any open spaces. Those other drivers must have
							been looking for parking too. I turn right and then right again to head back east down the next row.
							I see some open spaces, but I want to go as close as I can to the central crosswalk so I pass a few
							spaces – it’s hard to see if there are any closer ones, so I pick one about eight spaces from the
							crosswalk, on the left side. I use my turn signal and slow down, and then carefully turn left into
							the space, and then put the car in park. I turn off the car, get out, then close and lock the door
							behind me. From here it will take me about ten minutes to walk to the building, and since it took me
							an extra minute or so to find an available space, I might be a few minutes late to meet my husband.
							I’ll text him to let him know.</br></br>
							<b>Design Scenario:</b></br>
							<b>Persona:</b> Aniket Tanawade, R.I.T Student
							</br>
							<b>Setting:</b> RIT Parking Lot S
							</br>
							I’m driving to RIT today for my 9:30 class in Brown Hall. It’s cool and rainy today, so I hope I don’t
							have to walk too far in the rain. I’m driving my 2013 Volkswagen Polo, and I have my “Reserved” permit
							to allow me to park in the closest spaces to the buildings. The lot is very popular and the closest
							spaces are often full, so as I enter from Tyler Drive on the west side, I look up to consult the
							LotMonitor at the entrance. The LotMonitor consists of a 8 x 8 foot square display monitor mounted
							on a pole at the west side of Lot S, and at the top it displays in large bright green text: “Available
							Spaces: 200 of 622”. Beneath that, there is a graphical representation of Lot S, with all the occupied
							spaces indicated with a red ‘O’ and all vacant spaces indicated with a green ‘V’. Handicapped spaces
							are outlined with a blue rectangle and reserved spaces are outlined with a yellow diamond shape. The
							colors are a quick indication for those with typical vision, while the letters provide the necessary
							information for colorblind drivers. The building is on the east side of the lot, and I can see that
							all of the closest spaces in the second and third rows are filled, but the fourth row has several open
							spaces fairly close to the east side of the lot, so I turn right at the fourth row and drive toward
							the building. I see one car heading east in front of me in the same row, and the driver parks in a
							free spot on the left. I saw on the display that there were still two more available spots on the
							right side of the row further east, so I continue driving, and I find the open spaces, as expected.
							I use my turn signal and pull into a space. I know that the LotMonitor’s sensors in the parking lot
							will detect my car and change this space from a white rectangle to a Red signal to indicate to later
							arrivals that this space is no longer available. The number of available spaces will also be decremented
							as necessary. I get out, lock the car, and head to my 9:30 class; it looks like I’ll be five minutes early.
